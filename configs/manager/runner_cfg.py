"""Runner-level configuration loaded from YAML.

Holds the values the runner used to take exclusively from CLI flags (task,
num_envs, num_agents, total_timesteps, memory_size, eval_timesteps, seed).
Moving them into YAML lets a launcher invoke the runner with just a config
path + experiment name, while CLI flags remain available as one-off overrides
when provided.
