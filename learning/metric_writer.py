"""Per-agent metric sink: TensorBoard always, Weights & Biases optionally.

``BlockAgent`` publishes every scalar through a per-agent
``skrl.utils.tensorboard.SummaryWriter`` (``write_tracking_data``). To mirror
those same scalars to Weights & Biases WITHOUT touching the ~30 ``add_scalar``
call sites, we wrap each per-agent writer in :class:`MetricWriter`, a drop-in
that exposes the exact ``add_scalar(tag=, value=, timestep=)`` / ``flush`` /
``close`` surface ``write_tracking_data`` (and the runner's shutdown loop) use.

Backend selection is the single ``experiment.wandb`` bool already present on
skrl's ``ExperimentCfg`` — no new config field. When it is True, each of the
``num_agents`` block-parallel agents gets its OWN wandb run (grouped under the
experiment name), faithfully mirroring today's N overlaid TensorBoard runs.

wandb semantics handled here:
  * One concurrent run per agent via ``wandb.init(reinit="create_new")`` — each
    returns an independent ``Run`` we ``.log()`` to explicitly (no global
    ``wandb.run`` collision between agents in the same process).
  * Scalars added within one ``write_tracking_data`` interval share a timestep;
    we BUFFER them and emit a single ``run.log(dict, step=timestep)`` on
    ``flush()`` — one network round-trip per agent per interval, and wandb's
    monotonic-step rule is satisfied because timesteps increase across intervals.
  * ``close()`` calls ``run.finish()``, which blocks until the run is synced.
    The runner's shutdown loop already calls ``flush(); close()`` on every
    per-agent writer BEFORE ``os._exit(0)`` (which would otherwise kill wandb's
    background sync), so no runner change is needed — same hazard/fix as the
    synchronous TensorBoard ``flush()``.

    immediately; wandb scalars are buffered per interval and committed on
    ``flush()`` (see module docstring).

    ``config_path`` is the per-agent ``config.yaml`` the runner dumps (the exact
    merged + CLI-applied runtime config used to reconstruct a run). It does not
    exist yet at construction time — the runner dumps it after ``agent.init()`` —
    so we attach it to the run at ``close()`` (via ``run.save(policy="now")``),

    file to the run's Files tab as ``runtime_config.yaml`` (NOT as an artifact,
